## Quick Start Options

### Option 1: AI Image Generation (Fastest)

**Use ChatGPT with DALL-E:**
1. Go to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
2. Use this prompt:
```
Create a professional photograph of a skier in dynamic action on a snowy mountain slope. The image should show:

- A skier in a carved turn, side view, dynamic pose
- Bright cyan/blue AI pose detection dots on key joints (head, shoulders, hips, knees, ankles)
- Connected skeleton lines between the pose points in bright cyan
- Small coaching text labels like "Good form", "Adjust angle", "Lean forward"
- Professional ski analysis app interface elements
- Clean, bright snowy mountain background
- High contrast and professional lighting
- 1200x800 pixel dimensions (3:2 aspect ratio)

Style: Realistic photography with modern tech UI overlay, professional ski coaching application
```

**Use Midjourney:**
```
Professional skier in dynamic carved turn on snowy mountain slope, side view, with bright cyan AI pose detection points overlaid on joints (head, shoulders, hips, knees, ankles), connected skeleton lines, small coaching text labels "Good form", "Adjust angle", "Lean forward", futuristic ski analysis interface, clean modern UI, bright lighting, realistic photography style, 3:2 aspect ratio --ar 3:2 --style raw --v 6
